## 3. COMMUNICATION HEALTH METRICS

Metrics quantify conversation health, helping teams understand issues and take action. Each metric returns **ordinal enum-based responses** (like "Poor/Good/Excellent") rather than raw numbers to improve reliability when using LLMs - this approach is more accurate for AI analysis and enables flexible score weighting for different customer needs. Every metric evaluation includes an **AI-generated explanation** of why that specific rating was assigned.

| Metric                          | What It Measures                                 | Output Options                                                                            | Max Points | User Value                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Sentiment Classification** | Overall emotional tone of the conversation       | Positive / Neutral / Negative                                                             | 30         | Early detection of relationship decline or uplift |
| **2. Participant Engagement**   | Level of active participation and responsiveness | Highly Engaged / Moderately Engaged / Poorly Engaged                                      | 30         | Reveals imbalance or lack of engagement           |
| **3. Concern Handling Quality** | How well concerns/questions were addressed       | Comprehensive / Substantial / Partial / Surface-Level / Unaddressed                       | 30         | Highlights churn risk if concerns ignored         |
| **4. Communication Clarity**    | Clarity and effectiveness of communication       | Crystal Clear / Mostly Clear / Somewhat Unclear / Frequently Confusing / Incomprehensible | 40         | Prevents miscommunication and failures            |

### Detailed Metric Descriptions

**Sentiment Classification:**
Analyzes overall tone—positive is upbeat and encouraging, neutral is balanced, negative signals frustration or hostility. Helps teams catch early signs of relationship stress or opportunity.

**Participant Engagement:**
Measures how actively all parties participate. Poor engagement often signals dissatisfaction or imbalance, which can harm the relationship.

**Concern Handling Quality:**
Evaluates completeness and relevance of responses to customer issues. Surface-level or unaddressed concerns indicate risk of churn.

**Communication Clarity:**
Rates how clearly ideas are conveyed. Unclear communication risks misunderstandings and damaged trust.

## 4. RELATIONSHIP INTELLIGENCE FLAGS

Flags are specific detected patterns with assigned severity and impact on health scores. Each flag detection includes an **AI-generated explanation** of the specific evidence found and reasoning for the detection.

### Critical (Red) Flags — Require Immediate Attention

- **Repetitive Unaddressed Concerns** (Score impact: -30): Same issue raised 3+ times without resolution. Signals systemic failure.
- **Escalation Language** (-12): Use of words like "unacceptable", "disappointed", or demands to escalate.
- **Tone Deterioration** (-15): Shift from friendly/casual to formal/cold tone mid-conversation.
- **Conversation Shutdown** (-15): Dismissive or non-engaging behaviors blocking dialogue.

### Warning (Yellow) Flags — Monitor Closely

- **One-Sided Effort** (-10): Conversation effort is heavily imbalanced.
- **Question Avoidance** (-14): Direct questions receive non-answers or topic changes.
- **Declining Enthusiasm** (-8): Noticeable drop in energy or engagement over time.

### Positive (Green) Flags — Healthy Patterns

- **Mutual Collaboration** (+8): Both parties contribute thoughtfully.
- **Constructive Concern Handling** (+10): Concerns addressed with solutions and empathy.

### Informational (Blue) Flags — Context Awareness

- **High Stakes:** Money, deadlines, or major decisions are involved.
- **External Pressure:** External factors (boss/client) influencing dynamics.

# Part 2: ENGINEERING ARCHITECTURE

## 6. ARCHITECTURAL PHILOSOPHY & DECISIONS

### Core Design Principles

**1. Configuration-Driven Architecture**
Rather than hardcoding metrics and flags, the entire system is driven by a JSON configuration file. This enables:

- Rapid iteration on metrics and scoring without code changes
- Customer-specific calibration (different industries, teams, use cases)
- Easy A/B testing of different evaluation approaches
- Non-technical stakeholders can modify scoring logic

**2. Modular Subgraph Architecture**
The system uses a graph constructor that combines modular subgraphs:

- **Clean separation of concerns:** Each subgraph handles one aspect (sentiment, flags, scoring)
- **Parallel execution:** Multiple metrics can be evaluated simultaneously
- **Easy extensibility:** New evaluation types can be added as new subgraphs
- **Testability:** Each subgraph can be tested independently
- **Reusability:** Subgraphs can be mixed and matched for different workflows

**3. Confidence-Aware Processing**
Every LLM evaluation includes a confidence assessment, enabling:

- **Reliability filtering:** Low-confidence results are excluded from final scores
- **Transparency:** Users see what was excluded and why
- **Quality control:** Prevents unreliable LLM outputs from affecting decisions
- **Gradual degradation:** System still functions with partial confidence rather than failing completely

**4. Dynamic Model Generation**
Pydantic models are generated dynamically from configuration:

- **Type safety:** Ensures runtime validation of LLM outputs
- **Automatic adaptation:** New metrics automatically get proper validation
- **Development efficiency:** No need to manually create models for each new metric

## 9. RELIABILITY & CONFIDENCE SYSTEM

### 9.1 Confidence-Based Filtering

Each LLM evaluation includes confidence levels:

- **very_high:** Clear evidence, no ambiguity
- **high:** Strong evidence with minor uncertainty
- **moderate:** Some evidence, some ambiguity
- **low:** Weak evidence, significant uncertainty
- **very_low:** Minimal evidence, high uncertainty

### 9.2 Filtering Logic

**For Metrics:** If confidence is below threshold, use default/neutral scoring
**For Flags:** Only apply flag penalties if confidence meets minimum requirement
**For Users:** Show excluded items and reasoning in uncertainty report

### 9.3 Benefits

- **Reduces false positives:** Prevents unreliable detections from affecting scores
- **Maintains system credibility:** Users trust results more when uncertainty is acknowledged
- **Graceful degradation:** System provides partial results rather than failing

## 10. CUSTOM vs CONFIGURABLE FLOWS

### 10.1 Hybrid Architecture Design

The system supports both:

**Configurable Flows:** Standard metrics and flags defined in JSON

- Automatically generate analysis nodes
- Parallel execution for efficiency
- Easy to modify and extend

**Custom Flows:** Complex logic requiring specialized implementation

- Custom flows can be implemented as their own subgraphs
- Domain-specific analysis patterns
- Multi-step reasoning processes

### 10.2 Subgraph Types

**ConcernAnalysisSubgraphCreator:** Custom logic for:

1. Identifying concerns/questions in conversation
2. Assessing how well each concern was addressed
3. Overall concern handling quality evaluation

**ConfigBasedEvaluationSubgraphCreator:** Automatically generates nodes for:

- All configurable metrics (sentiment, engagement, clarity)
- All configurable flags (critical, warning, positive, info)

**ScoringSynthesisSubgraphCreator:** Combines results into:

- Confidence-filtered scoring
- Health level determination
- Final assessment synthesis
